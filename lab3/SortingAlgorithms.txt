Sorting Algorithms

Insertion sort
inserting next element into a sorted sublist
like bubble sort, where adjacent nodes are swapped
but every insertion ensures the final correct position 
    - Best case:  O(n)
    - Worst case: O(n^2)

Selection sort
always select the minimum, place in order at beginning 
    - Best case:  O(n^2)
    - Worst case: O(n^2)

Bubble sort
Compare and swap adjacent nodes
    - Best case:  O(n)
    - Worst case: O(n^2)

Merge sort
Divide array in halves, recusively
Sort individual elements, merge()
    - Best case:  O(nlogn)
    - Worst case: O(nlogn)

Quick sort
set pivot as last
swap leftmost value greater than pivot with rightmost value smaller than pivot
swap pivot with the greater value once left>right
    - Best case:  O(nlogn)
    - Worst case: O(n^2)
